# EKS Nodegroup Rotation

This repo holds the nodegroup rotation workflow which will create one node in new nodegroup and delete one node from older nodegroup in rolling restart fashion. 
And, also transfer the workload from older nodegroups to new nodegroups.

## Description
Node rotation involves replacing existing nodes within a cluster with new nodes without disrupting the overall functionality of the applications running on the cluster. This process ensures that the cluster remains healthy, secure, and up-to-date with the latest software patches and security fixes.
